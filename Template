In order to create a new website, it is suggested to create new virtual environment first. 

We can do it by creating 'Environments' folder, and then going there and creating virtual environment by the command 'virtualenv name_of_project_env'. 

Once the virtual environment is created we can go and activate it by the command 'name_of_project_env\Scripts\activate'

We can deactivate it by the command 'deactivate'

In order to create flask inside our environment we need to put the command 'set FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py', but first need to import flask if we don't have it yet.

To run it, we need to type 'flask run'

To run it in debug mode 'set FLASK_DEBUG=1'

In order to run our project, we can also use 'python flaskblog.py'

*rembmer to be in the same directory
